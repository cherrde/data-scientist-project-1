<h1>So You Want To Be A Seattle AirBNB Mogul.</h1>

Maybe you've taken a vacation and used a service like AirBNB or VRBO to book your rental. You enjoyed your experience and decided, that doesn't look so hard.
You live in the greater Seattle Area and maybe have a property or some money. You want to be successful and by that you mean have a well priced option or options 
and receive high ratings. Where should you start, what sorts of units should you be looking at. What characteristics of those units bring in top dollar?

Well, here's a place to start. I analyzed a tranche of data concerning AirBNB and tried to figure out some answers to those questions. The questions I looked at were:
1. Are there some features that correlate to higher ratings or satisfaction?
2. Is there a pattern 
3. Are there certain features that translate to better pricing?
Bonus Question: Are there better zip codes for prices?

Let's investigate each one in turn.
